            <t1>How to correctly set length of cable with coils?</t1>
            <div>
            To place order for cable with coils correctly you need add to cart
            1) straight cable from creator 2) coils from special menu below creator. 
            If you buy multiple cables please write in description which one has to come with coils.
            Length of cable between keyboard connector and coils by default is 5 cm. 
            Length of coils you choose won’t be built in overall length of cable. For example: if you order 1m cable with 15cm of coils, the cable will be exactly 1,15m.
